                  <p>
                    As a teacher, I guide students to develop critical thinking
                    skills and become community-engaged citizens who recognize
                    that texts, whether they're written, aural, multimodal, or
                    some other form completely, are informed by time, place, and
                    social interactions. Moreover, through looking for and
                    learning from ignored vernacular literacies (like cooking
                    and technological literacy), I emphasize that such
                    epistemologies have huge effects on society even if we
                    ignore them. Thus, in any course I teach (whether it's basic
                    writing, composition, rhetoric, technical writing, or
                    creative workshops), I aim to develop students' critical
                    awareness of the multiple literacies they hold alongside an
                    understanding of their audience through community-engaged
                    research and multimodal assignments.

                  <h3>User-Centered Design: Writing for Edge Users</h3>
                  <p>
                    The ultimate focus of my pedagogy is for students to develop
                    multiliteracies, which cultivates an awareness of how the
                    modes we use to communicate “differ according to culture and
                    context, and have specific cognitive, cultural, and social
                    effects” (Cope and Kalantzis, 2000, p. 5). But it's
                    important, I believe, that students' awareness extends
                    beyond their literacies to the multiliteracies of their
                    user-audiences. Therefore, I encourage students to take a
                    user-centered approach to writing and designing documents.
                    To do so, I teach students about user personas, which are
                    fictional profiles that represent a multitude of users, from
                    someone who has no experience with a product or service to
                    someone who uses it every day. Through researching users and
                    creating personas, for instance, students in my technical
                    writing classes develop an awareness of “a theoretical
                    person who engenders empathy” (Friess, 2017, p. 118) and
                    learn to tailor their writing for different rhetorical
                    situations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Part of developing multiliteracies, then, involves creating
                    user personas for “edge users” or novice users often ignored
                    during the design process. For instance, in a technical
                    instruction set project, I have students begin by
                    researching and creating user personas for two edge users to
                    teach technical concepts (from seasoning a cast iron skillet
                    to designing a train model in Autodesk Inventor) to
                    non-technical audiences. They state their anticipated users,
                    conduct interviews, and find sources demonstrating what
                    novice users know about their topic. Based on their
                    research, students determine how users are most likely to
                    interact with their instructions (will they be included with
                    the purchase of an item, or should they be added to the
                    wikiHow database of how-to guides?) and design their
                    instruction set accordingly. In researching and analyzing
                    users, my technical writing students demonstrate how they've
                    crafted a critical awareness of their user-audience's
                    communication strategies, which leads to a stronger focus on
                    understanding and connecting to their users through the most
                    effective communicative mode.

                  <h3>
                    Engaging with the Community: Solving Real-World Problems
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Also central to my pedagogy is that communication, rhetoric,
                    and writing courses can solve real-world problems within the
                    community. For example, through connecting writing
                    assignments to problems like food insecurity, my students
                    develop a greater rhetorical awareness and understanding of
                    their audience (House, 2014) while building a relationship
                    between the university and community that might lead to
                    tangible solutions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When I teach grant applications in technical writing, I
                    introduce engineering students to food insecurity issues. As
                    a class, we conduct secondary research on what it means to
                    be food insecure in the United States and identify existing
                    solutions to the problem. After reviewing sources that
                    convey the larger problem of food insecurity (like Feeding
                    America's Map the Meal Gap study), we focus on our location.
                    As they move from the broader implications across the
                    country to the impact of access to high-quality food and
                    local food systems in Oklahoma, students work in teams to
                    write grant proposals for the Community Food Projects
                    Competitive Grants Program. For example, during the summer
                    2020 grant unit, students determined that the most pressing
                    problem associated with food insecurity in Oklahoma City was
                    access to fresh produce. As a result, each team decided to
                    research and write proposals to build community gardens.
                    Though the groups proposed the same overall solution, teams'
                    projects ranged from reclaiming abandoned lots around the
                    city to creating a hydroponic garden to provide year-round
                    produce and account for Oklahoma's weather patterns. Through
                    grounding projects in a problem within our community, I find
                    that students are encouraged to think critically about
                    issues of access from a community-centered point of view
                    while developing an understanding of how to engage in public
                    discourse.

                  <h3>
                    Multimodality: Valuing Embodied Literacies Throughout the
                    Writing Process
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    One of the primary theories that informs how I teach and
                    create assignments is that “all texts are always multimodal
                    although one modality among these can dominate” (Kress,
                    2000, p. 187). As an instructor, this emphasis on
                    multimodality means incorporating various media. When
                    thinking about multimodality, as Jody Shipka (2011) says,
                    “it is crucial that we not limit our attention to a
                    consideration of new media texts or to what the newest
                    computer technologies make possible&mdash;or even make
                    problematic&mdash;but attend to the highly distributed,
                    complexly mediated, multimodal dimensions of all
                    communicative practice” (p. 29). Understanding food as a
                    communicative practice is one way to teach students a
                    critical awareness of how material and technological choices
                    can incorporate and foster their multiliteracies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To teach students how to write food narratives in a
                    multimodal composing course, I begin by having them choose a
                    recipe that evokes a significant memory. Then, we spend four
                    weeks working with one recipe to understand how food
                    narratives incorporate three elements: location, senses, and
                    history/politics. Students begin to embody their recipe by
                    visiting the space most closely associated with it
                    (location), cooking and eating the food while paying
                    attention to their senses with a particular emphasis on
                    smell, taste, and sound (senses), and researching the origin
                    of the recipe and its ingredients (history/politics).
                    Students document their recipe interactions by writing blog
                    posts, creating Instagram stories, or recording audio pieces
                    throughout the process. Though the form for their final
                    piece is open-ended, each student creates autoethnographic
                    compositions that capture their food narrative through text,
                    image, video, and cooking, but the composition doesn't rely
                    on digital media alone. Through making the food, I find
                    students make more informed decisions about the modality
                    that best serves their food narrative's purpose. By
                    incorporating low-stakes assignments that require students
                    to embody their food and cook, eat, and share it with
                    others, students gain a broader understanding of how their
                    senses are interconnected with their literacies and inform
                    their communicative practices.
