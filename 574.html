                <h3>Course Description</h3>
              </header>
		    <p>This course will introduce you to the ways that media has been studied in the field of rhetoric, composition, and literacy. We will discuss what new media is, focus on the evolution of communication technologies, and examine the cultural, social, and pedagogical impacts of our mediated world. Each week explores a theme relevant to new media studies and its connections to the field more broadly. Weekly themes include multimodal composition, digital rhetoric, and video games. Through readings and production practice&mdash;low-stakes assignments that ask you to play with composing techniques and technologies&mdash;you’ll develop an understanding of how to study and create with new media.</p>

              <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Understand the ways new media have been studied in rhetoric, composition, and literacy</li>
                <li>Develop nuanced understandings of new media and its importance in history and contemporary society, culture, and politics</li>
                <li>Analyze and evaluate ideas, arguments, and interpretations</li>
                <li>Develop advanced skills in writing and presenting</li>
                <li>Compare and evaluate approaches, theories, and methods that relate to the study and understanding of new media</li>
                <li>Engage in an interdisciplinary conversation about composing, communication technologies, and new media </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Course Texts &amp; Required Materials</h3>
		    <h4>Texts</h4>
		    <p>You probably noticed that there aren’t any books required for purchase. That’s because many of the books we’ll read are open-access. The rest of the materials are either hosted on websites or provided via PDF; however, you might decide you need access to an entire text for your final project or that you need to read a related book. Our course relies heavily on independent research, and you’ll need to plan to utilize the library to request sources.</p>
		    <p>The Texts and Tools WO page provides additional resources to help you begin your research. Materials will be added throughout the semester. </p>
		    <h4>Required Materials</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Discord</li>
                <li>Canva or your favortie resource for creating slides</li>
                <li><a href="https://web.hypothes.is/" target="_blank">hypothes.is</a></li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Assignment Descriptions</h3>
              <h4>Weekly Reading Responses (10%)</h4>
		    <p>Each week, you will write a response (~500 words, single-spaced) or explore a technology that engages the assigned texts. I’ll provide specific prompts for some weeks, but in general, I’m not looking for right or wrong answers here. Consider these responses a space for you to play with ideas and make connections across readings that might contribute to your final project. Do not simply summarize the texts. Each response must: </p>
		    <ul>
			    <li>Apply 1&ndash;2 of the theories from the texts to what you’re interested in applying to your final project; for example, if you want to create a unit on podcasting for an undergraduate class, use a theory from that week to start doing this work</li>
			    <li>Identify and explain key terms/concepts in a way that makes sense to you</li>
			    <li>Explore connections across weeks; for example, how do readings from week 2 “talk” to week 5?</li>
			    <li>Pose questions that could guide class discussion or your final project</li>
		    </ul>

		    <h4>Discussion Leader: In-Class Presentations (10%)</h4>
		    <p>Each week, one person will be responsible for leading the class discussion and identifying the central claims of that week’s text(s). Presentations will take up half our class time, making them about 75 minutes (I’ll lead the second half of class).</p>
		    <p>Each presenter must come to class with the following:</p>
		    <ul>
			    <li>Slides</li>
			    <li>1-page handout to guide us through your presentation (include key terms/concepts, guiding questions, etc.</li>
			    <li>Reading summaries</li>
			    <li>Discussion questions</li>
			    <li>1-2 activities that engage the text(s)</li>
			    <li>Issues and connections for the class to explore</li>
			    <li>Examples (popular or additional scholarly texts) for the class to review that illustrate the issues and/or perspectives from the assigned texts </li>
		    </ul>
		    <p><strong>An example handout and detailed presentation expectations will be provided. </strong></p>
		    <h4>Midterm: Annotated Bibliography (20%)</h4>
		    <p>For your midterm, you’ll turn in an annotated bibliography of at least 10 sources on a topic of interest related to rhetoric, composition, literacy, pedagogy, and new media studies. Your annotated bibliography is a space to do a deep dive into sources you’ll need for your final project. Your annotations will be evaluative and must show connections across sources.</p>
		    <p>General Annotated Bibliography Requirements</p>
		    <ul>
			    <li>APA (7th edition)</li>
			    <li>10 sources total </li>
			    <ul>
				    <li>Can include up to 7 sources from class</li>
			    <li>You must find, read, and annotate at least 3 sources on your own</li>
				    <ul>
			    <li>2 paragraphs per source</li>
			    <ul><li>Paragraph 1 summarizes the source</li>
			    <li>Paragraph 2 makes connections across sources and evaluates its effectiveness for your potential final project</li></ul>
			    </ul>
			    <p>Note: If you’re using multiple chapters from the same book, please talk to me. We will determine if you need to annotate chapters separately or if they should be combined.</p>
		    <p><strong>A detailed assignment sheet will be provided.</strong></p>
		    <h4>Project Draft + Peer Review (10%)</h4>
		    <p>I believe drafting is a crucial part of the writing process. You’ll submit a partial draft and receive feedback from your peers. This grade includes the draft submission and your participation in peer review.</p>
		    
		    <h4>Final Project (50%)</h4>
		    <p>Your final project should explore new media studies from one or more perspectives we’ve studied. All approaches/methods are welcome, but you will work with me to define a direction.</p>
		   
		    <h5>Project Proposal + Meeting (10%)</h5>
		    <p>You’ll write a project proposal of no more than 500 words to state your final project topic. You’ll indicate what research exists, the project’s exigency, what you already know, and what you hope to learn. Each final project option will require a slight modification to your proposal (to be explained in the full assignment sheet).</p>
		    <p>We’ll have a short meeting (~15 minutes) to discuss your project. </p>

		    <h5>Options (30%)</h5>
		    <p><strong>Option 1: Keyword Synthesis Project</strong></p>
		    <p><em>4,000 words, excluding references</em></p>
		    <p>How is “fan” defined by rhetoric and writing studies scholars? What about “celebrity,” “memory,” or “text”? Our readings explored some of these key terms, but there is more to learn—more to know. For the Keyword Synthesis Project, you’ll choose one or two terms to research in depth. You’ll craft a literature review of scholarship that frames how the field understands this term through your research. </p>

		    
		    <p><strong>Option 2: Multimodal Review</strong></p>
		    <p><em>“Word count” varies based on mode; excludes references</em></p>
		    <p>Writing reviews helps us engage scholarship on a deeper level. Choose one book or five articles that have some sort of connection and write a cohesive review. You can choose from texts we read in this course or find something that piques your interest. Your review must be more than written words. You’ll use <a href="https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/cfr.html" target="_blank"><em>Kairos</em>’s Call for Reviews</a> as your guidelines and choose a mode that fits the content (e.g., webtext, podcast, video, etc.). </p>

		    <p><strong>Option 3: Develop a Digital Rhetoric Project</strong></p>
		    <p><em>4,000 words, excluding references</em></p>
		    <p>Using Doug Eyman’s (2014) <cite>Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice</cite> as a guiding text, craft a research project that applies one or a combination of the methods Eyman explains. Research a topic, artifact, individual, or community of interest to you. Use the weekly course topics as a starting point (e.g., research a fandom). </p>

		    <p><strong>Option 4: Teaching With New Media Studies</strong></p>
		    <p><em>1 teaching portfolio; includes portfolio cover letter, an annotated unit plan, 1 full lesson plan with in-class activities and homework, and the final assignment sheet + rubric</em></p>
		    <p>How would you teach students in a 100-, 200-, or 300-level English course theories of and/or how to compose with new media? Would you create a podcasting unit? What about a unit where students play and review video games? Or how about a collaborative class comic? Create the materials you’d need to teach a unit and explain your choices by explicitly connecting texts from this course to your materials.</p>

		    <h5>Final Presentation (10%)</h5>
		    <p>On the last day of class, you will give a 7–10-minute presentation with an additional 3 minutes for questions. The purpose of the presentation is to tell us what you’re doing for your final project and show off your work. The presentation is a celebration of your ideas and a way for you to improve your academic presentation skills. </p>
		    <p><strong>Detailed assignment sheets will be provided. </strong></p>
